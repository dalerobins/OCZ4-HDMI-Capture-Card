# OCZ4-HDMI-Capture-Card
OZC4 (2021-03-1) MS2109/MS9333 Based HDMI USB Capture Device With 4K Loopthrough

Picked up this cheap HDMI USB Capture Device from Amazon, I needed one that had HDMI Passthrough as I want to use it with my HDMI Microscope.
Taken some pictures of the device externally and internally, pictures taken of the PCB and IC's with my microscope. I've dumped the 24C32 EEPROM and put the files on here.
